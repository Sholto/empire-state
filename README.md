[![Node CI](https://github.com/karlvr/immutable-state-controller/actions/workflows/github-actions-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/karlvr/immutable-state-controller/actions/workflows/github-actions-build.yml)

Two small libraries to manage mutable and immutable state without a lot of boilerplate, but with a lot of type-safety using TypeScript.

* [`immutable-state-controller`](./packages/immutable-state-controller) is for any JavaScript environment
* [`react-immutable-state-controller`](./packages/react) is for use in [React](https://reactjs.org)
